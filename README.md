## What's the motive of this platform?

In this modern world we can't stay alive without each other's help. 
We all get stuck at any point of time in our life. Luckily we have our parents to support us,
but how long they can support?

So introducing our new platform which will help people from worldwide to discuss their problems with other's and get their problems solved, if you are lucky you can get help from other's or you can help other's to make their day nice!

There is a common saying "If you help someone you may not have changed the world, but the help
can change the world for that person!"
